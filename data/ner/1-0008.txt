Retaining him as Commissioner for Science and Technology when Governor  Babatunde Fashola  assumed office in 2007 was natural because because of his comprehensive rollout plan of designed initiatives that permanently changed the face of data and record keeping in the State.

In 2011, Dr Hamzat was appointed Lagos State Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure; a position he held till May 2015.

His notable achievements are but not limited to; the completion of the Lekki-Ikoyi Bridge linking Admiralty Way to Bourdillon Road, Nigeria’s first cable-stayed bridge and the construction of the Lekki Expressway with the upgrade, expansion and maintenance of approximately 50km of the Lekki-Epe Expressway (Phase I), and construction of Yaya Abatan road, Cemetry Road in Ajeromi Ifelodun, Expansion of Lagos Badagry expressway with a rail (blue line) and other infrastructures across the State.
For his extraordinary performance and technical abilities, Babatunde Raji Fashola, Minister for Power, Works and Housing appointed him as his Special Adviser Technical.
In this advisory role, which he occupied from January 2016 to August 2018, Hamzat was Adviser to the Honourable Minister on roads and other infrastructure assets. In addition to this, he also served as Consultants to Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) on public infrastructure such as Architectural designs, Structural designs, Quantity surveying, Mechanical and Engineering devices.
His forte also extended to Quality control of Civil Engineering and Building Projects, Planning, Designing and Implementation of Infrastructure Programme as well as Rehabilitation and Maintenance of Roads & Bridges and Research & Development.
In October 2018, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), picked Dr. Kadri Obafemi Hamzat, as his running mate for the Lagos governorship election in 2019. As a team, they had a resounding victory at the polls.
