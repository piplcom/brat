He allegedly “threw a pumpkin and all insides of the pumpkin at the subject,” according to the complaint.
Garisto told police that he’d actually thrown the gourd “at the sliding doors," not his girlfriend.
He pleaded not guilty to the misdemeanor count and was free on a $1,000 bond. Garisto was ordered to not have contact with his girlfriend and to wear an alcohol monitor.
