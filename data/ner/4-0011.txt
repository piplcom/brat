Capitol Heating and Cooling in the news
Article 1 Article 2
Founded in 1963, Capitol Oil has been dedicated to providing unsurpassed customer service and quality.
Family owned and operated, Capitol Oil was started by two brothers, Edward and William Zacharias.  The business was housed in a Shell station on the corner of Brookland Park Boulevard and Chamberlayne Avenue, right in the heart of Richmond.  Before it expanded to where it is today, the company serviced cars and installed major brand tires and sold gasoline.
Growth to meet customer demand.
Capitol Oil grew and moved its headquarters to Chesterfield County. The brothers purchased an oil truck soon after opening, and began delivering to its customers throughout the Greater Richmond and surrounding areas.
Today the company still delivers oil to customers throughout Central Virginia and as far as from Charlottesville to the Chesapeake Bay.
The business grows
Capitol Oil expands to Capitol Heating and Cooling
In the early 70âs, Capitol added central air-conditioning and heating services. Then in the 90âs, not content with their extensive line-up of HVAC and plumbing services, the company added to its fleet of service vehicles and began offering propane and expanded its oil delivery area. But the brothers had a higher vision for the company.
Reaching into other markets, Expanding services.
Since its humble beginnings, the Capitol Oil name evolved over the years to Capitol Heating and Cooling that today services residential, commercial, light industrial and multi-tenant apartment buildings through its heating, cooling and plumbing operations. The team also added a duct cleaning operation as well as GeneracÂ® generators to the line-up.
A Proven History and Track Record of Customer Service done right.
Capitol defines itself with customer service that can't be beat.  "We don't let just anybody work for us in the service department," Ed Zacharias adds. "We stress people skills along with knowledge and ability to get a job done in the most efficient way. We have the patron's interest at heart."  From our family to yours we deliver comfort and unsurpassed customer service at the fairest price.
