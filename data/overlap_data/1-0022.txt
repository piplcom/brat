Management
Management
With an average tenure of over 25 years, our management team is one of the most experienced and talented in the industry. Our large network of customers, colleagues and other industry experts regard The Seydel Companies as true thought leaders, innovators and problem solvers. We’re proud of our reputation and the fact that The Seydel Companies is an employee owned and managed business.
Scott Seydel, Sr. – Chairman & Chief Innovation Officer, The Seydel Companies
Scott Seydel studied chemistry at Georgia Tech and began his career as a weaver, loom mechanic, and quality control supervisor while at the University of North Texas . Intrigued by the growth of textile manufacturing in developing countries, Scott garnered agency representations from a dozen U.S. companies and formed Seydel International as a chemical and equipment exporter. Shortly thereafter, Scott and his growing team of professionals formed The Seydel Companies to license the use of chemical and equipment manufacturing technologies from U.S. companies as a basis for forming joint ventures, subsidiaries, and licensed partnerships in over two dozen countries. During the 1980s, recognizing potential problems with persistent and non-biodegradable chemicals, the Company shifted its raw material emphasis to renewables and focused on biodegradable and recyclable products and packaging applications.
The Seydel Companies expanded to the North American market through acquisitions from Toyo Soda (Japan), Reynolds Chemicals (SC) and Valley Proteins (NC), and expanded its R&D to include water and oil barrier coatings and lubricants for the paper, packaging, metal working, cosmetic, leather, and animal health and feed industries, and has since earned a plethora of patents for products in these application arenas.
Over the past four decades, Scott has devoted much of his career toward creating environmental awareness and stewardship. He is currently a Board Trustee of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation US and has chaired the Global Green board and a Board Director of Mikhail Gorbachev’s Green Cross (Geneva). He is chair emeritus of Elemental Impact and the GreenBlue Institute and a founder of its Sustainable Packaging Coalition . He is a former Board Member of the National Recycling Coalition and the Vice Chair of the Container Recycling Institute . Through his work with these organizations, Scott helped create The Coalition for Resource Recovery .
Scott has also served as Chairman of the Board for Georgia State University’s Robinson College, the metro Atlanta YMCA, the Georgia Hi-Tech Alliance, the Georgia World Congress Institute and the Atlanta Chamber’s International Committee during the 1996 Olympic Games. Scott is an active contributor of articles and technical reviews for the trade press, and a frequent guest speaker on environmental conservation and global sustainability at industry conferences, seminars, and universities. Scott and Pat Mitchell Seydel share six children and thirteen grandchildren who reside in Chicago, New York, and Atlanta and who they consider to be their greatest assets and participatory achievements.
