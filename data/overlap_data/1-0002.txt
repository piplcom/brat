Richard M. Englert, President
President Richard M. Englert brings a depth of experience and institutional perspective as he serves the third year of his presidency and the 43rd year of his Temple career—a span that rivals that of Temple founder Russell Conwell. He is passionate about the success of Temple students, faculty and staff, and is a stalwart champion of the university’s mission to offer a high-quality education that is accessible, affordable and diverse.
Under his leadership, the university welcomed its largest and most academically qualified class of new students and broke records for freshman applications. It also began major campus renovations, highlighted by the new, state-of-the-art Charles Library. At the same time, Temple’s faculty gained unprecedented national recognition, and its student-athletes reached new levels of success on the field and off.
“I can say without reservation that there has never been a better time to be part of the Temple family, whether you are a student, faculty member, administrator or alumnus,” Englert said. “We have a strong dedication to our mission and an unrelenting commitment to our students, our neighbors and our great city.”
For four decades, President Englert has always responded to Temple’s call, having served with loyalty and distinction in 16 different capacities, including teacher, administrator and leader. Temple’s Board of Trustees appointed him to the role of chancellor in 2012 and president in 2016.
Englert arrived at Temple as an assistant to the dean of the College of Education. Over the years, he has been provost and interim senior vice president for academic affairs, dean of the College of Education and vice president for administration, among many other roles. Since 1985, he has served as a professor in the College of Education. 
Englert earned a doctorate in educational administration from the University of California, Los Angeles. He also has a master’s degree from Pepperdine University and a bachelor’s degree from St. John’s College.
