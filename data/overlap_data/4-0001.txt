Linda A. Livingstone, Ph.D.
Dr. Linda A. Livingstone is the 15th president of Baylor University. She previously served as dean and professor of management at The George Washington University School of Business, as dean and professor of management at Pepperdine University’s Graziadio School of Business and Management, and as a tenured faculty member and associate dean of graduate programs at Baylor’s Hankamer School of Business.
As Baylor’s president, Dr. Livingstone has overseen the development of Baylor’s academic strategic plan, Illuminate, which details Baylor’s pursuit of becoming a preeminent Christian research university, and the $1.1 billion comprehensive campaign that undergirds Illuminate, called Give Light.
A strong voice for the role of faith-based institutions in American higher education, Dr. Livingstone has established herself as a scholar in organizational behavior, leadership, creativity, and university accreditation. She has been extensively published and cited in academic and professional outlets, including American Business Review, Journal of Organizational Behavior, Journal of High Technology Management Research, and the book Business and Corporate Integrity: Sustaining Organizational Compliance, Ethics and Trust. She serves on the Board of Directors of Capital Southwest Industrials, the Board of Trustees for Baylor College of Medicine, the Board of Directors of the American Council on Education and the Board of Directors for Independent Colleges and Universities of Texas, Inc. In addition, she was recently elected to the executive committee of the Big 12 Conference Board of Directors, for which she serves as treasurer.
Dr. Livingstone was inducted into Oklahoma State’s Hall of Fame in 2019. She also is a member of the Spears School of Business Hall of Fame and was the first recipient of the Outstanding Ph.D. Alumnus Award. She was recognized in 2015 with the OSU Distinguished Alumni Award.
A native of Perkins, Oklahoma, Dr. Livingstone played varsity basketball at Oklahoma State University, where she earned a Bachelor of Science in economics and management, a Master of Business Administration, and a Doctor of Philosophy in management and organizational behavior. Her husband, Brad, a high school history teacher, also played basketball at Oklahoma State. They have one daughter, Shelby, a current student at Baylor’s George W. Truett Theological Seminary.
