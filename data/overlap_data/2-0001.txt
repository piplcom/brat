A former police officer has been indicted for driving into an alleged looter with an unmarked police vehicle as he ran from a skate shop that was vandalized during protests in Portland over the summer.
Scott Groshong, who retired from the Portland police force in August, is facing charges of official misconduct, third-degree assault and failure to perform the duties of a driver, The Oregonian reported. The 27-year veteran was working undercover surveillance the night of June 15, when he and his partner heard glass breaking near the Portland Skate and Snowboard shop.

Separate video recorded by a witness sees the unmarked black van speeding east on Davis St. in pursuit of the man, who was eventually struck as he tried to cross the street. The impact was enough to knock him off his feet, but he was quick to stand and start running again.

The alleged looter was arrested just a few blocks away, but his burglary and criminal mischief charges were later dismissed. He went on to accuse Groshong of driving into him on purpose and then driving away.
The former officer has denied intentionally hitting the man, who has not been named, and instead claimed he ran in front of the police vehicle.
“Instead of the suspect facing consequences for looting, this veteran police officer finds himself the target of misplaced criminal charges,” Daryl Turner, the president of the Portland Police Association, said in a statement.
“Incredibly, this suspect now claims the police knowingly hit him with the undercover surveillance van when the officer drove towards him to document his criminal acts. That claim is false, self-serving, and runs completely counter to the independent eyewitness who observed the suspect running away from the scene of his crime.”
